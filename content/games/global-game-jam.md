<a href="http://globalgamejam.org/">Global Game Jam</a> is a tradition for us and a phenomenon worldwide. If you haven't experienced one please do, they happen annually!

## [2016](http://globalgamejam.org/2016/games/ritual-river) Ritual River
The gods have appointed you to collect the holy water from the river for your village in this daily ritual. If you let your village dehydrate you will be banished. Good luck and god speed.

## [2015](http://globalgamejam.org/2015/games/elemental-adventures-eustace-hook) Elemental Adventures of Eustace Hook
A 2D platformer game where it starts at the closing of a previous adventure. The hero drops/breaks the relic he has worked so hard to work for. Thus, what do we do now? As the hero progresses through the game ‘to find their new meaning’ he will use his hookshot, face enemies, grow stronger, fight 3 mini bosses and ultimately the final boss. The final boss has a resistance to all three elements (unless the corresponding mini boss is defeated first)
