## #[37](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-37/?action=preview&uid=113517) Hacker Café
Welcome to the Hacker Café, the only room you'll ever need to spend time in again!

At the Hacker Café, you use their computers, and the security is a little lacking to say the least. You'll be bombarded with pings from questionable sources. It's up to you to decide how (and IF) you want to respond.

Making decisions will affect your bitcoin, hacker rep (white hat vs black hat), software and hardware. Keep everything in balance to stay alive, make it to the top and most importantly, get that 1337 status.

How long will you survive?
